# 0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0

Welcome to the first installment of our web stack debugging projects! In this series, we tackle broken or buggy web stacks within isolated containers and work to restore them to a functional state. For each task, I've crafted a script that automates the necessary commands to fix the web stack.

## Task Details

### Task 0: Give Me a Page!
- Script: 0-give_me_a_page
- Description: This Bash script launches an Apache web server and ensures that it responds to queries made to the root URL.
