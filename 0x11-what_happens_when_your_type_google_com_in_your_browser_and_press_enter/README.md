# Web Infrastructure: Understanding How the Web Works

When you enter "www.google.com" in your browser, a complex web infrastructure comes into play. Let's explore the journey from domain entry to fully loaded web pages. This article covers several essential topics:

1. **DNS Request**:
   - The **Domain Name System (DNS)** translates human-readable domain names (like "www.google.com") into IP addresses (like "172.217.3.110").
   - When you type a URL, your browser sends a DNS request to find the IP address associated with that domain.

2. **TCP/IP**:
   - The **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** and **Internet Protocol (IP)** form the foundation of internet communication.
   - TCP ensures reliable data transmission, while IP handles addressing and routing.

3. **Firewall**:
   - Firewalls act as security barriers between your network and external threats.
   - They filter incoming and outgoing traffic, allowing authorized communication while blocking unauthorized access.

4. **HTTPS/SSL**:
   - **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** encrypts data transmitted between your browser and web servers.
   - **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)** or **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocols provide this encryption.

5. **Load-Balancer**:
   - Load balancers distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers.
   - They enhance scalability, availability, and performance by evenly sharing the load.

6. **Web Server**:
   - Web servers (like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS) host websites and serve web pages to clients.
   - They handle HTTP requests and deliver content to browsers.

7. **Application Server**:
   - Application servers execute dynamic code (e.g., PHP, Java, Python) to generate web content.
   - They interact with databases, process user input, and create personalized responses.

8. **Database**:
   - Databases store structured data (such as user profiles, product information, or blog posts).
   - Common types include relational databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (like MongoDB).
