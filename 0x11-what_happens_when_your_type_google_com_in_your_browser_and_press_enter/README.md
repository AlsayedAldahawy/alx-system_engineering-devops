An article that delves into the intricacies of web infrastructure and explore how the web functions—from the moment you enter “www.google.com” in your browser until the web page fully loads. This article covers several essential topics:

DNS Request:
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (like “www.google.com”) into IP addresses (like “172.217.3.110”).
When you type a URL, your browser sends a DNS request to find the IP address associated with that domain.
TCP/IP:
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) form the foundation of internet communication.
TCP ensures reliable data transmission, while IP handles addressing and routing.
Firewall:
Firewalls act as security barriers between your network and external threats.
They filter incoming and outgoing traffic, allowing authorized communication while blocking unauthorized access.
HTTPS/SSL:
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) encrypts data transmitted between your browser and web servers.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols provide this encryption.
Load-Balancer:
Load balancers distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers.
They enhance scalability, availability, and performance by evenly sharing the load.
Web Server:
Web servers (like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS) host websites and serve web pages to clients.
They handle HTTP requests and deliver content to browsers.
Application Server:
Application servers execute dynamic code (e.g., PHP, Java, Python) to generate web content.
They interact with databases, process user input, and create personalized responses.
Database:
Databases store structured data (such as user profiles, product information, or blog posts).
Common types include relational databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (like MongoDB).
